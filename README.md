# A/O 15APR Test of Win10 non domain joined VM was functional - All settings and applications were applied, including some unnecessary, but still wanted to test. (both full office ?13/16? suites, visio, skype, ect)

#Didn't focus on this for the last two days, and it still needs a lot of work and cleanup based on Nando's guidance.

# Included the log file of the 347,000+ lines in the script root folder of settings applied.

# On my Windows 10 pro VM, running only 2Gb ram, 2Proc. It took 30ish minutes to apply all the settings.
